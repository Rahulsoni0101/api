# Google-News-Feed

In this project, I made Google-News-Feed App, where user can read and browse News. The App uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), the React's Framework for server-side rendering with [Ant.D](https://ant.design/), as the UI/UX Library. The app starts with first 10 Recent-News only, for the better optimaztion. The News-feed gets populated as the user scrolls down the page, ordered from most-recent to old-ones. The User can get the full News, by clicking on particular feeds.

## Requirements and Execution

First and foremost, clone this repository, and navigate to the directory. Fire-up your terminal and type `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies from `package.json` file.
<br>
Now, type `npm run dev` to start the development server, and your app is running at http://localhost:3000/.
<br>

Although, the App has already been hosted on [**AWS**](https://aws.amazon.com/) at https://news.reactapp.cf/ <br>
Happy Coding:)
